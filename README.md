# Orange-Juice
Simple Currency Cheat for 100% Orange Juice [Steam]. All it does is set each currency type to their maximum values so you can buy whatever you want from the store. Version 1.26.1 Removed the valentine event.

[Latest Release](https://github.com/tsuneko/Orange-Juice/files/1777061/999.Orange.Juice.Steam.1.26.zip)

Static Offsets for 1.26:

- Stars = 0x474C58
- Fruits = 0x475B78
- Halloween Candy = 0x475954
- Christmas Candy = 0x475958

To-do:
- Implement AOB scans to find offsets automatically

Disclaimer:

100% Orange Juice is a VAC enabled game. I'm fairly sure VAC only checks process signatures when you are online in a match, so only use this program when you have the shop open. If you're scared of getting VAC banned, use cheat engine instead. To use static offsets in cheat engine, go to Add Address Manually and enter 100orange.exe+(hex offset). If you're too scared to use cheat engine, I suggest you go earn your money legitimately.  Use entirely at own risk. I am not responsible for anything which can happen in regards to usage of my sources and/or releases.
